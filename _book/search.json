Dataset 2 is similar to that used in the Module 2 problem set, but not exactly the same, so be sure to use the correct dataset for this problemset.\n\n4.2.1 Dataset 1\nIn this study, researchers examined the effect of control versus reduced food intake (FoodIntake) on the longevity (LifeSpan.yr) of male and female (Sex) monkeys. These data are from Whitlock and Schluter (2015, 2nd Edition) problem 35, page 63.\nThis dataset can be downloaded directly from GitHub with the following code:\n\nMonkey\n\n\nBIOL827.03 Problem Set Data 1.csv\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Dataset 2\nA researcher was conducting an exercise physiology study. The research team wanted to know whether volunteers of different sexes (Sex) differed in physical characteristics, especially Body Mass Index (BMI), over the first five weeks (Week) of the study and if there was a change in their oxygen consumption during exercise (V\\(O_2\\) max, measured as mm/kg body weight) over this time. For each volunteer, the research team recorded the initial weight (Weight.kg), height (Height.m), and V\\(O_2\\) max (VO2) of each participant.

    "text": "4.3 Procedure\nPlease note that this is not quite identical to the regular module PDFs, but is close.\n\nWatch Module 3: Describing and Visualizing Data in R for a walk-through of these initial procedures. Note that this video will vary slightly from this particular document.\nOpen a new R script in the source pane by clicking on the File menu &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nIf necessary, clear the environment and plots panes from R’s memory by clicking the broom icon at the top of both of these panes and clear the console by clicking on Edit menu &gt; Clear Console.\nSet your working directory and import both datasets. Review Modules 1 and 2 procedures, if necessary, for a reminder of how to complete these tasks.\n\n\nFor these procedures and video, dataset 1 was imported as a dataframe object named ‘Monkey’, and dataset 2 as a dataframe object named ‘BMI’.\n\nDescriptive statistics refers to simple calculations that summarize or describe a given variable. Measures of central tendency commonly used are the mean (i.e., average) and median (i.e, \\(50^{th}\\) percentile). Corresponding measures of spread are standard deviation (accompanying the mean) and interquartile range or \\(25^{th}\\) and \\(75^{th}\\) percentiles (accompanying the median).\n\n4.3.1 Section A. Calculate mean and standard deviation\n\nUse the Monkey dataset (Data 1) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of LifeSpan.yr variable separately for each FoodIntake treatment (Control, Reduced) by hand using equations provided in the textbook. Afterwards, calculate these values using RStudio!\nTo do this, subset the Monkey dataframe using the subset function. Create one subset with data for individuals in the reduced food intake group and one for those in the control group (Figure 1).\n\n\nBe sure to give each subset a unique object name to use below.\nReview use of the subset function in PS1 and PS2, if needed.\n\n\nNext, activate the package ‘pastecs’ using the library() command (Figure 1) so you can use the stat.desc function.\n\n\nReview instructions for activating a package in PS2, if needed.\n\n\nRun the function ‘stat.desc’ on the LifeSpan.yr variable for each subset (Control and Reduced) separately (Figure 1).\n\n\nIf necessary, highlight the object name to print the output to the console pane.\n\n\nCompare the mean and standard deviation (std.dev) for each food intake group to those you calculated by hand. They should be the same.\n\n\nAlso, note the median is provided in this output.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Section B. Calculate median (50th), 25th and 75th percentiles, and interquartile range (IQR)\nQuantiles are a way of looking at the response value at which a given percentage of observations are captured. The most common quantiles are the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. This specific set of quantiles are also called quartiles: 1st quartile (25th percentile), median (50th percentile), and 3rd quartile (75th percentile). The interquartile range (IQR) measures spread representing the middle 50% of observations; that is, 25% of observations fall below the 25th percentile and 25% of observations are above the 75th percentile.\n\nCalculate the median, first quartile, third quartile, and interquartile range separately for each FoodIntake group (Control, Reduced) by hand using the information provided in the textbook and/or lecture material. Now, calculate it using RStudio.\nTo do this, use the function ‘quantile’ separately for each FoodIntake group (Control, Reduced) using the command: object &lt;- quantile(Dataframe$Variable) (Figure 2).\n\n\nBy default, the quantile function returns the following percentiles: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%.\nCompare results for the 50% output from function quantile to the median calculated by hand and from stat.desc for each FoodIntake group. They should match.\n\n\nCalculate IQR in RStudio using function ‘IQR’ separately for each FoodIntake group (Control, Reduced) using the command: object &lt;- IQR(Dataframe$Variable) (Figure 2).\nCompare these values to those you computed by hand. They should be the same. Section C. Install and activate the ggplot2 R add-on package\nClick on the Packages tab in the lower-right panel and install ggplot2.\n\n\nReview instructions on how to install a package in PS2, if needed.\n\n\nOnce installed, go to the source panel and activate the package (Figure 3).\n\n\nReview instructions on how to activate a package in PS2, if needed.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Section D. [Optional] Create histogram using function ggplot\nThere are multiple ways to graph data in R, to illustrate we can compare histograms produced using the hist() function from PS1 and PS2 and using function ggplot() in the ggplot2 package.\n\nFor each FoodIntake group (Reduced, Control), create a histogram using the function hist (Figure 3).\n\n\nReview instructions on how to do this in PS1, if needed.\n\n\nFor each FoodIntake group (Reduced, Control), create a histogram using the function ggplot. ggplot has the generic syntax: Object &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x.variable, y.variable)) + geom_histogram() (Figure 3).\n\n\nggplot(): identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute.\naes(): goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced. Other attributes can also be specified here, but we’ll get to more on that later.\ngeom_histogram(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to make is a histogram.\n\n\nHighlight the command and click Run. To view the graph in the plots panel, highlight or type the object name) and click Run.\nCompare the histograms created by the hist function to those from ggplot. They should look very different. This is because the default in ggplot() is to create histograms with 30 bins, while the number of bins in the graph created with the hist() function is determined by an algorithm and on the nature of observations in the dataset.\nChange the number of bins in the ggplot histogram by adding bins=5 or bins=6 inside the parentheses of the geom_histogram function (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Section E. Create a boxplot using package ggplot2\n\nCreate one boxplot that illustrates both FoodIntake groups (Reduced, Control) on the x-axis using function ggplot. The generic syntax is: Object &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x.variable, y.variable)) + geom_boxplot() (Figure 5).\n\n\nggplot(): identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe ‘Monkey’ because it has data for both Control and Reduced food intake groups.\n\nBox 1. ggplot function syntax object &lt;- ggplot(dataframe, aes(x, y)) + geom_() The ggplot2 package includes a wide variety of options for the content and format of graphs – both in the types of graphs drawn and how they are formatted. We will keep it to the simplest basics this week and introduce additional options later. Types of graphs we will work with this week:\n\ngeom_histogram(): creates a frequency histogram, only a y variable needs to be identified in the ggplot() portion of the command.\ngeom_boxplot(): creates a boxplot displaying the medan (bold line), 1st and 3rd quartiles (box), 1.5 times the iqr (whiskers), and outliers (circles).\ngeom_bar(): creates a bar chart. if specified, the x variable should represent categories to be graphed separately.\ngeom_point(): creates an xy scatterplot. both x and y variables should have numeric data.\ngeom_line(): creates a line plot. typically, a time variable is represented on the x-axis. Customization introduced this week:\nTo create graphs with groupings, include a group=GroupingVariable attribute after the y variable in aes() so it becomes aes(x, y, group=).\nTo have a different color represent each group, also add a color=“ColorName” attribute after the group attribute so it becomes aes(x, y, group=, color=).\nTo change the axis labels, add + labs(x=NewXName, y=NewYName, title=”Graph title”) after the geom() portion of the command.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_boxplot(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to make is a standard boxplot (see more in Box 1).\n\n\nHighlight the command and click Run. To view the graph in the plots panel, highlight or type the object name) and click Run.\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Section F. Clearly label axes\nIt is important to clearly label axes to indicate the variable(s) plotted avoiding abbreviations and acronyms as much as possible. Axes labels should always also indicate the unit of measurement that graphed values represent.\n\nAdd a title to the graph and change the appearance of the axis labels by adding a new layer to the graph created in Section E. After geom_boxplot() and on the same line, add “+”\nGo to a new line, and add: labs(x= “x label (units)”, y= “y label (units)”, title= “Graph title”) where the label and units for the x and y axes and graph title are typed within the quotation marks. (For example, see line 58 in Figure 6 below).\n\n\n\n4.3.6 Section G. Create a bar chart using package ggplot2\n\nCreate one bar chart that illustrates the mean lifespan for each FoodIntake group (Reduced, Control) on the x-axis using function ggplot. The generic syntax is: Object &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x variable, y variable)) + geom_bar(stat=“summary”, fun=“mean”) (Figure 5).\n\n\nggplot(): identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe ‘Monkey’ because it has data for both Control and Reduced food intake groups.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced. Other attributes can also be specified here, but we’ll get to that more later.\ngeom_bar(stat=“summary”, fun=“mean”): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to make is a bar chart and that the values to graph are mean life span calculated from summary statistics.\n\n\nHighlight the command and click Run. To view the graph in the plots panel, highlight or type the object name) and click Run.\n\n\n\n4.3.7 Section H. Create an XY scatterplot using package ggplot2\n\nImport the second dataset containing the BMI project data.\n\n\nFor illustrations here and in the video, I called this dataframe ‘BMI’.\n\n\nCreate one scatterplot that illustrates the relationship between height on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis using function ggplot. The generic syntax is: Object &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x variable, y variable)) + geom_point() (Figure 6).\n\n\nggplot(): identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe ‘BMI’ because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_point(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each set of height-weight observations as a point.\n\n\nHighlight the command and click Run. To view the graph in the plots panel, highlight or type the object name) and click Run.\n\n\n\n4.3.8 Section I. Create a line graph using package ggplot2\n\nCreate one line graph that illustrates changes in weight (on the y-axis) over time (on the x-axis) using function ggplot. The generic syntax is: Object &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x variable, y variable)) + geom_line() (Figure 6).\n\n\nggplot(): identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe ‘BMI’ because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_line(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each weight observation over time is with a continuous line.\n\n\nAdd a title to the graph and change the appearance of the axis labels, we can add a new layer to the graph with: + labs(x= “New X label”, y= “New Y label”, title= “Graph title”) after the geom call (line 58 in Figure 6).\nHighlight the command and click Run. To view the graph in the plots panel, highlight or type the object name) and click Run.\nNotice that the resulting graph does not seem to make much sense. This is because in this case there were three observations for each time (one from a person of each sex category) and each individual observation is included on the graph. ### Section J. Create a line graph using package ggplot2 with an individual line for each sex\nIn this case, it would be more meaningful to have a separate line for each sex so we can better examine trends over time. To do this, modify the code from section G or begin a new command in which a grouping variable is identified. The generic syntax is: Object &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x variable, y variable, group=GroupingVariable)) + geom_line() (Figure 7).\n\n\nggplot(): identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe ‘BMI’ because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced. Notice here we added group= and will identify the sex variable in order to tell RStudio we want each sex to have its own line in the graph.\ngeom_line(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each weight observation over time is with a continuous line.\n\n\nIf we want to add a title to the graph and change the appearance of the axis labels, we can add a new layer to the graph with: + labs(x= “New X label”, y= “New Y label”, title= “Graph title”) after the geom call (Figure 7).\nHighlight the command and click Run. To view the graph in the plots panel, highlight or type the object name) and click Run (Figure 8).\nIt would be even more meaningful yet to have each line in a different color for each sex. To do this, modify the code from section H or begin a new command in which we tell R to vary colors by a particular variable. The generic syntax is: Object &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x variable, y variable, group=GroupingVariable, color=GroupingVariable)) + geom_line() (Figure 9).\n\n\nggplot(): identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe ‘BMI’ because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced. Notice here we have group=Sex and also add color=Sex to tell RStudio we want each sex to have its own line in the graph and the line representing each sex should be a different color.\ngeom_line(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each weight observation over time is with a continuous line.\n\n\nHighlight the command and click Run. Then, highlight the object name and click Run.",
