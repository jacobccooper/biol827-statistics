Dataset 2 is similar to that used in the Module 2 problem set, but not exactly the same, so be sure to use the correct dataset for this problemset.\nThese data can be downloaded as .csv files from the class dataset repository and imported locally or downloaded directly from the source as follows.\n\n4.2.1 Dataset 1\nIn this study, researchers examined the effect of control versus reduced food intake (FoodIntake) on the longevity (LifeSpan.yr) of male and female (Sex) monkeys. These data are from Whitlock and Schluter (2015, 2nd Edition) problem 35, page 63.\nCopy and paste the following code to import the Monkey dataset into your R session.

The research team wanted to know whether volunteers of different sexes (Sex) differed in physical characteristics, especially Body Mass Index (BMI), over the first five weeks (Week) of the study and if there was a change in their oxygen consumption during exercise (V\\(O_2\\) max, measured as mm/kg body weight) over this time. For each volunteer, the research team recorded the initial weight (Weight.kg), height (Height.m), and V\\(O_2\\) max (VO2) of each participant. These data were randomly generated; any patterns are unintentional.

    "text": "4.3 Procedure\n\nWatch Module 3: Describing and Visualizing Data in R for a walk-through of these initial procedures. Note that this video may vary slightly from this particular document.\nOpen a new R script in the source pane by clicking on the File menu &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nIf necessary, clear the environment and plots panes from R’s memory by clicking the broom icon at the top of both of these panes and clear the console by clicking on Edit menu &gt; Clear Console.\nSet your working directory and import both datasets. Review Modules 1 and 2 procedures, if necessary, for a reminder of how to complete these tasks.\n\n\nFor these procedures and video, dataset 1 refers to the Monkey dataset and dataset 2 refers to the BMI dataset.\n\nDescriptive statistics refers to simple calculations that summarize or describe a given variable. Measures of central tendency commonly used are the mean (i.e., average) and median (i.e, \\(50^{th}\\) percentile). Corresponding measures of spread are standard deviation (accompanying the mean) and interquartile range or \\(25^{th}\\) and \\(75^{th}\\) percentiles (accompanying the median).\n\n4.3.1 Section A. Calculate mean and standard deviation\n\nUse the Monkey dataset (Data 1) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of LifeSpan.yr variable separately for each FoodIntake treatment (Control, Reduced) by hand using equations provided in the textbook. Afterwards, calculate these values using RStudio!\nTo do this, subset the Monkey dataframe using the subset function. Create one subset with data for individuals in the reduced food intake group and one for those in the control group.\n\n\nBe sure to give each subset a unique object name to use below.\nReview use of the subset function in previous problem sets, if needed.\n\n\nMonkey.reduced &lt;- subset(Monkey, FoodIntake == \"Reduced\")\nMonkey.control &lt;- subset(Monkey, FoodIntake == \"Control\")\n\n\nNext, activate the package pastecs using the library command so you can use the stat.desc function.\n\n\nReview instructions for activating a package in previous problem sets, if needed.\n\n\nlibrary(pastecs)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'pastecs'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    first, last\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    extract\n\n\nYou can ignore the above warnings, but these refer to “conflicts” with same-named commands in different packages. We will not be using these commands in this module, but the issue can be circumvented by naming the package in the command (e.g., dplyr::first vs. pastecs::first).\n\nRun the function stat.desc on the LifeSpan.yr variable for each subset (Control and Reduced) separately.\n\n\nIf necessary, highlight the object name to print the output to the console pane.\n\n\nstat.desc(Monkey.reduced$LifeSpan.yr)\n\n     nbr.val     nbr.null       nbr.na          min          max        range \n  22.0000000    0.0000000    0.0000000   19.4000000   34.5000000   15.1000000 \n         sum       median         mean      SE.mean CI.mean.0.95          var \n 578.8000000   26.3500000   26.3090909    0.6883983    1.4316026   10.4256277 \n     std.dev     coef.var \n   3.2288741    0.1227285 \n\n\n\nstat.desc(Monkey.control$LifeSpan.yr)\n\n     nbr.val     nbr.null       nbr.na          min          max        range \n 22.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000  25.20000000  36.40000000  11.20000000 \n         sum       median         mean      SE.mean CI.mean.0.95          var \n685.90000000  31.40000000  31.17727273   0.55906275   1.16263464   6.87612554 \n     std.dev     coef.var \n  2.62223674   0.08410732 \n\n\nNote that if so desired, we can also have R round all of these outputs to a specific value for us:\n\nround(stat.desc(Monkey.control$LifeSpan.yr),2)\n\n     nbr.val     nbr.null       nbr.na          min          max        range \n       22.00         0.00         0.00        25.20        36.40        11.20 \n         sum       median         mean      SE.mean CI.mean.0.95          var \n      685.90        31.40        31.18         0.56         1.16         6.88 \n     std.dev     coef.var \n        2.62         0.08 \n\n\n\nCompare the mean and standard deviation (std.dev) for each food intake group to those you calculated by hand. They should be the same.\n\n\nAlso, note the median is provided in this output.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Section B. Calculate median (50th), 25th and 75th percentiles, and interquartile range (IQR)\nQuantiles are a way of looking at the response value at which a given percentage of observations are captured. The most common quantiles are the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. This specific set of quantiles are also called quartiles: 1st quartile (25th percentile), median (50th percentile), and 3rd quartile (75th percentile). The interquartile range (IQR) measures spread representing the middle 50% of observations; that is, 25% of observations fall below the 25th percentile and 25% of observations are above the 75th percentile.\n\nCalculate the median, first quartile, third quartile, and interquartile range separately for each FoodIntake group (Control, Reduced) by hand using the information provided in the textbook and/or lecture material. Now, calculate it using RStudio.\nTo do this, use the function quantile separately for each FoodIntake group (Control, Reduced) using the following: object &lt;- quantile(Dataframe$Variable) (Figure 2).\n\n\n# generic format for quantile function\nobject &lt;- quantile(dataframe$variable)\n\n\nBy default, the quantile function returns the following percentiles: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%.\nCompare results for the 50% output from function quantile to the median calculated by hand and from stat.desc for each FoodIntake group. They should match.\n\nAn example for the control group is shown here:\n\ncontrol.quantiles &lt;- quantile(Monkey.control$LifeSpan.yr)\n\nprint(control.quantiles)\n\n    0%    25%    50%    75%   100% \n25.200 29.625 31.400 32.725 36.400 \n\n\n\nCalculate IQR in RStudio using function IQR separately for each FoodIntake group (Control, Reduced) using the command: object &lt;- IQR(Dataframe$Variable).\nCompare these values to those you computed by hand. They should be the same.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Section D. [Optional] Create histogram using function ggplot\nThere are multiple ways to graph data in R, to illustrate we can compare histograms produced using the hist function and ggplot in the ggplot2 package (and included within the already-loaded tidyverse package).\n\nFor each FoodIntake group (Reduced, Control), create a histogram using the function hist.\n\nExample histogram for Control:\n\nhist(Monkey.control$LifeSpan.yr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each FoodIntake group (Reduced, Control), create a histogram using the function ggplot. ggplot has the generic syntax:\n\n\nObject &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x.variable, y.variable)) + geom_histogram()\n\nWhere:\n\nggplot: identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute.\naes(): goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the x-axis and y-axis of any graph produced. Other attributes can also be specified here, but we’ll get to more on that later.\ngeom_histogram(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to make is a histogram. You can specify the number of bins desired by using the bins argument here, otherwise R with suggest a default number.\n\nExample using the Control subset:\n\nggplot(data = Monkey.control, aes(x = LifeSpan.yr)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlight the command and click Run. To view the graph in the plots panel, highlight or type the object name) and click Run. You can also click Control + Enter (Windows, Linux) or Command + Enter (Mac) to automatically run the same line as the cursor.\nCompare the histograms created by the hist function to those from ggplot. They should look very different. This is because the default in ggplot is to create histograms with 30 bins or the number of bins specified, while the number of bins in the graph created with the hist function is determined by an algorithm and on the nature of observations in the dataset.\nChange the number of bins in the ggplot histogram by altering the bins argument to values such as bins=5 or bins=6 inside the parentheses of the geom_histogram function.\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Section E. Create a boxplot using package ggplot2\n\nCreate one boxplot that illustrates both FoodIntake groups (Reduced, Control) on the \\(x\\)-axis using function ggplot. The generic syntax is:\n\n\nObject &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x.variable, y.variable)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\nggplot: identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attributes. In this case, we will call the dataframe Monkey because it has data for both Control and Reduced food intake groups.\nxlab, ylab, theme_classic: these are graphical parameters that change the axes labels and clean up the background, respectively. Try running the code with and without these parameters.\n\n\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot(Monkey, aes(x = FoodIntake, y = LifeSpan.yr)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nprint(plot1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(Monkey, aes(x = FoodIntake, y = LifeSpan.yr)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  xlab(\"Food Intake\") +\n  ylab(\"Lifespan (Years)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\nprint(plot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many other types of graphs that we will create in this class using R as well, including:\n\ngeom_histogram: creates a frequency histogram, only a \\(y\\) variable needs to be identified in the ggplot portion of the command.\ngeom_boxplot: creates a boxplot displaying the median (bold line), 1st and 3rd quartiles (box), 1.5 times the interquartile range (whiskers), and outliers (circles).\ngeom_bar: creates a bar chart. if specified, the \\(x\\) variable should represent categories to be graphed separately.\ngeom_point: creates an \\(xy\\) scatterplot. both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) variables should have numeric data.\ngeom_line: creates a line plot. typically, a time variable is represented on the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\nCustomization introduced this week:\n\nTo create graphs with groupings, include a group = GroupingVariable attribute after the \\(y\\) variable in aes() so it becomes aes(x, y, group= variable).\nTo have a different color represent each group, also add a color = variable so it becomes aes(x, y, color = variable). To have the color fill the entire box, use fill = variable.\nTo change the axis labels, add + labs(x = NewXName, y = NewYName, title = \"Graph title\") after the geom_histogram portion of the command.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_boxplot: this tells ggplot that the type of graph to make is a standard boxplot.\n\n\nRun the command(s) to view the plot(s).\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Section F. Clearly label axes\nIt is important to clearly label axes to indicate the variable(s) plotted avoiding abbreviations and acronyms as much as possible. Axes labels should always also indicate the unit of measurement that graphed values represent.\n\nAdd a title to the graph and change the appearance of the axis labels by adding a new layer to the graph created in Section E. Create a boxplot using package ggplot2. After geom_boxplot and on the same line, add +.\nGo to a new line (click enter or return), and add: labs(x = \"x label (units)\", y= \"y label (units)\", title= \"Graph title\") where the label and units for the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes and graph title are typed within the quotation marks.\n\n\n# example plot with colors and labels\nggplot(Monkey, aes(x = FoodIntake, y = LifeSpan.yr, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Food Intake\", y = \"Lifespan (Years)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.6 Section G. Create a bar chart using package ggplot2\n\nCreate one bar chart that illustrates the mean lifespan for each FoodIntake group (Reduced, Control) on the \\(x\\)-axis using function ggplot. The generic syntax is:\n\n\nObject &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\nggplot: identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe Monkey because it has data for both Control and Reduced food intake groups.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis of any graph produced. Other attributes can also be specified here, but we’ll get to that more later.\ngeom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\"): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to make is a bar chart and that the values to graph are mean life span calculated from summary statistics.\n\n\nRun the command(s) to view the plot(s).\n\nExample:\n\nggplot(Monkey, aes(x = FoodIntake, y = LifeSpan.yr)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.7 Section H. Create an XY scatterplot using package ggplot2\n\nImport the second dataset containing the BMI project data. See instructions in Dataset 2.\nCreate one scatterplot that illustrates the relationship between height on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis using function ggplot. The generic syntax is:\n\n\nObject &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\nggplot: identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe BMI because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_point(): this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each set of height-weight observations as a point.\n\n\nRun the command(s) to view the plot(s).\n\n\nggplot(data = BMI, aes(x = Height.m, y = Weight.kg)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Height (m)\", y = \"Weight (kg)\") +\n  theme_minimal() # plot with only basic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, we can add in more parameters as well to make this more data-rich:\n\nggplot(data = BMI, aes(x = Height.m, y = Weight.kg, color = Sex)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) + # adjust size\n  labs(x = \"Height (m)\", y = \"Weight (kg)\") +\n  theme_minimal() # plot with only basic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.8 Section I. Create a line graph using package ggplot2\n\nCreate one line graph that illustrates changes in weight (on the \\(y\\)-axis) over time (on the \\(x\\)-axis) using function ggplot. The generic syntax is:\n\n\nObject &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x_variable, y_variable)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\nggplot: identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe BMI because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_line: this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each weight observation over time is with a continuous line.\n\n\nAdd a title to the graph and change the appearance of the axes labels, we can add a new layer to the graph with: + labs(x = \"New X label\", y = \"New Y label\", title = \"Graph title\") after the geom_line call.\nRun the command(s) and view the plot(s).\n\n\nggplot(BMI, aes(x = Height.m, y = Weight.kg)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Height (m)\", y = \"Weight (kg)\") +\n  theme_minimal() # plot with only basic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the resulting graph does not seem to make much sense. This is because in this case there were three observations for each time (one from a person of each sex category) and each individual observation is included on the graph.\n\n\n\n4.3.9 Section J. Create a line graph using package ggplot2 with an individual line for each sex\n\nIn this case, it would be more meaningful to have a separate line for each sex so we can better examine trends over time. To do this, modify the code from Section G. Create a bar chart using package ggplot2 or begin a new command in which a grouping variable is identified. The generic syntax is:\n\n\nObject &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x_variable, y_variable, group = GroupingVariable)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\nggplot: identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe BMI because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_line: this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each weight observation over time is with a continuous line.\n\n\nAdd a title to the graph and change the appearance of the axes labels, we can add a new layer to the graph with: + labs(x = \"New X label\", y = \"New Y label\", title = \"Graph title\") after the geom_line call.\nRun the command(s) to view the plot(s).\n\n\nggplot(data = BMI, aes(x = Height.m, y = Weight.kg, group = Sex)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Height (m)\", y = \"Weight (kg)\") +\n  theme_minimal() # plot with only basic lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be even more meaningful yet to have each line in a different color for each sex. To do this, modify the code from Section H. Create an XY scatterplot using package ggplot2 or begin a new command in which we tell R to vary colors by a particular variable. The generic syntax is:\n\n\nObject &lt;- ggplot(Dataframe, aes(x_variable, y_variable, \n                                group = GroupingVariable, \n                                color = GroupingVariable)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\nggplot: identifies the dataframe and the aesthetics with the aes() attribute. In this case, we will call the dataframe BMI because it has data for both height and weight variables.\naes(): this goes within the ggplot function. Here, identify the variables to be associated with the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis of any graph produced.\ngeom_line: this tells ggplot that the type of graph to represent each weight observation over time is with a continuous line.\n\n\nRun the command(s) to view the plot(s).\n\n\nggplot(BMI, aes(x = Height.m, y = Weight.kg,\n                group = Sex, color = Sex)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Height (m)\", y = \"Weight (kg)\") +\n  theme_minimal() # plot with only basic lines",

They conducted an experiment using 60 lots of Snow Puff variety corn kernels with each lot randomly assigned to being cooked using either a microwave oven or a conventional popper method. Researchers expected conventional cooking to result in fewer unpopped kernels than microwave cooking.\n\nFor each sample (Conventional, Microwave), calculate mean and 95% confidence interval. Round to the nearest 0.01 for full credit. Hint: use the R function round. (4 points)\nCreate a point graph illustrating the mean and confidence interval of each sample. (4 points)\n\n\nYou will be asked to paste an image/screenshot of your graph in Canvas.\n\n\nBased on the mean and 95% confidence interval, do you think the percent of unpopped kernels differs between cooking methods? Why or why not? (2 points)\n\nPrior to the study, the research team decided to use significance level \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). They conducted a one-sided t-test of the null hypothesis: percent unpopped kernels cooked with the conventional method is less than or equal to unpopped kernels cooked with the microwave method (i.e., \\(H_0: conventional \\le microwave\\)). They found the following: t-statistic (the test statistic) \\(t = -3.2863\\), \\(p = 0.9991\\).\n\nWhat is the alternative hypothesis? (3 points)\nBased on the result of the statistical test, what is the statistical conclusion (reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis)? (3 points)\nWhat does this statistical test result mean in terms of their original question? (3 points)\nIf researchers had instead planned to use a significance level \\(\\alpha=0.10\\), would the statistical conclusion have been different? Why or why not? (3 points)\nIf researchers had instead planned to use a two-sided statistical test, what would have been the statistical null hypothesis? Alternative hypothesis? (3 points)\nBased on what you have learned in this module, do you think results of a two-sided t-test would have led to a different statistical conclusion? Why or why not? (3 points)\nGiven the ultimate objective of this work (described above), would you use a one-sided t-test as they did here or a two-sided t-test if you were to replicate this experiment? Why?

(+1 point possible)\n\n\nIn Canvas, each species in the table associated with this question will be listed and you will be asked to indicate if that species demonstrated a statistically significant reduction, increase, or no difference in density near ruins compared to far from ruins based on information provided in that table (equivalent to parts a-c). You will also be asked to select the species showing the strongest evidence for an effect of distance from ruins (equivalent to part d).\n\n\n\n7 Submitting your work:\nThis Problem Set Assignment is set up using a Quiz format.
